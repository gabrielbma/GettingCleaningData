GettingCleaningData
===================

##About This Repository
This repository was created for submission of my Course Project for the Getting &amp; Cleaning Data course hosted on Coursera.

There are 4 files in this repository:
1.	ARyanSMSTidySamsungData.txt - this is the tidy data set that was submitted, and the set that is produced by my R Script
2.	CodeBook.md - my Code Book, which describes each variable, the data, and the transformation process from the raw data to my tidy data
3.	README.md - this file, which provides an explanation of the GettingCleaningData repo and its files
4.	run_analysis.R - my R Script that can be used to prouce ARyanSMSTidySamsungData.txt from the raw Samsung data
